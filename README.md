# Red Teaming Research

Welcome to my personal red teaming research repository. This project is the result of months of studying, testing, breaking things, rebuilding them, and trying to understand how real offensive security works from the ground up. It is not a copy of any course or book. Everything here is based on my own notes, experiments, and understanding.

This repo is built to be clean, structured, and fully beginner‑friendly while still going deep into advanced offensive security topics. My goal is to create a complete reference for anyone who wants to learn red teaming the right way, with real methodology, strong OpSec, and practical understanding.

## What this repo is

This project is a full documentation hub covering every phase of a red team operation. You will find theory, practical workflows, operational mindset, and custom tools I wrote for learning. Each section is written in simple, clear English without noise or unnecessary complexity.

If you’re new, you can go through the folders in order.
If you’re experienced, you can jump to the section you want and use it as a reference.

## What this repo is not

This repo is not meant to break laws or encourage illegal actions. Everything here is for learning offensive security in ethical, legal, controlled environments. I do not provide real-world attack data or anything harmful.
Everything is educational.

Structure

The repository is divided into logical stages:

### 0‑Foundations
Core concepts, methodology, mindset, frameworks, ethics.

### 1‑OpSec
How to operate safely, cleanly, and without leaving fingerprints.

### 2‑Infrastructure
C2 servers, redirectors, VPS setup, and operational infrastructure.

### 3‑Recon
Passive and active reconnaissance, automation tools, cloud recon.

### 4‑Initial Access
Phishing, payload delivery, macro attacks, web exploitation.

### 5‑Post Exploitation
Persistence, credential access, lateral movement, cloud actions.

### 6‑AD Attacks
Enumeration, Kerberos, privesc, domain dominance.

### 7‑Privilege Escalation
Windows, Linux, containers, cloud escalation.

### 8‑Bypassing Security
AV bypass, EDR evasion, obfuscation, injection techniques.

### 9‑Reporting
Writing clean reports, executive summaries, attack paths.

### Resources
Books, cheatsheets, glossary, case studies.

Each folder contains Markdown files plus custom scripts where needed.

Tools

Some sections include small tools I wrote for learning purposes. They are not “real world ready”, but they show concepts, automation ideas, and basic offensive coding skills. You can use them as templates to build your own tools later.

#### Why I built this

I wanted one place where I can:

document everything I learn

stay consistent with my growth

build a real portfolio

improve my offensive research writing

collect all concepts in one clean structure

help others who learn the same topics

This repo will continue to evolve as I learn more and expand the content.
