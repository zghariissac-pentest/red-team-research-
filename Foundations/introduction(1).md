# What is red teaming :

Red Teaming is a structured and goal driven approach to simulating real world adversaries. It isn't random hacking and it isn't a traditional penetration testing. A red team operation focuses on realistic threat behavior, operational discipline, and achieving defined mission objectives while remaining undetected. This repository provides a complete research oriented reference for modern red teamers who want to understand the full lifecycle from planning to reporting.

Red Teaming isn't a single skill. It is a blend of technical capabilities, operational security, infrastructure design, social engineering, exploit delivery, post exploitation, evasion, and strategic thinking. A strong red teamer understands not only how to break into systems but why each action matters and how it affects the overall mission.

This project organizes the red team workflow into clearly defined phases. Each phase includes explanations, methodologies, playbooks, and tools. The goal is to create a practical and deeply detailed knowledge base that covers both theory and execution. All content is written in a clean and simple style to support both beginners and advanced operators.

The focus of this repository is on realistic operations. That means using stealth, maintaining operational security, avoiding detection, and building repeatable processes. Every section is designed to help you think like an adversary, plan like an operator, and execute with precision.

By the end of this repository you should understand how modern adversaries operate, how red team engagements are planned and controlled, and how to move through the attack lifecycle without exposing your infrastructure or your operator identity. You will also learn how to document findings and communicate impact in a professional and structured way.

This is not a collection of random tips. It is a complete foundational guide built for long term learning and serious operators.
