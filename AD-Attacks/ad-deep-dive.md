# Active Directory Deep Explanation

This repo keeps the AD content simple and focused on practical red team work.

If you want deeper knowledge about:
- how AD authentication works
- Kerberos internals
- domain controller architecture
- trust relationships
- replication
- GPO internals
- forest design
- identity attack surface

I maintain a separate long‑form research repo here:
[https://github.com/zghariissac-pentest/pentest-cheatsheets.git]

That repo contains full explanations, diagrams, and references for advanced study.
