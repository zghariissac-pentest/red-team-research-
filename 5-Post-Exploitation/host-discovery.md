# Host discovery

Host discovery is the first step after gaining a foothold. The goal is to understand the local environment without making noise. Enumeration must stay passive as much as possible and avoid scanning patterns that alert defenders.

## Key objectives

Identify machines around the compromised host

Determine domain membership

Map reachable subnets

Discover critical assets silently

# Techniques
## Local enumeration

Query ARP cache

Collect local routing tables

Check DNS resolver cache

# Inspect active network connections
## These methods leave no obvious traces.

### Network discovery

Use broadcast protocols carefully

Query SMB, LDAP, or mDNS when needed

Avoid full port scans on internal networks

Prefer system-native commands that blend in

### Service identification

Identify reachable servers

Detect critical services such as domain controllers

Map high-value targets through controlled probes

### Opsec considerations

Avoid noisy scans

Use long sleep timers and random delays

Blend in with normal system traffic

# TOOLS :
```
Get-NetNeighbor
Get-NetRoute
Get-DnsClientCache
Get-NetTCPConnection
```
# Python silent scanner (stealth mode):
```
python host_discovery.py --arp --routes --dns
```
## Included tool: host-discovery-light.py

A clean script that:

Extracts ARP entries

Enumerates routes

Finds reachable hosts with single-packet probes

Generates a compact report
