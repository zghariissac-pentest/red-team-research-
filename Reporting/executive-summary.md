# executive-summary
## Purpose

The executive summary explains the assessment in simple and non-technical language for managers and leadership teams.

What we found

Weak password policies

Several exposed internal services

Multiple misconfigurations in Active Directory

Paths that allow attackers to escalate privileges

Lack of proper monitoring or alerting

## What this means

An attacker with limited access could move inside the environment and reach sensitive data. The issues identified increase the risk of unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and internal compromise.

## Recommended focus

Strengthen identity security

Fix AD misconfigurations

Improve monitoring

Apply segmentation

Enforce password and MFA policies
